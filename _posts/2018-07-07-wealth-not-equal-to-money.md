Interesting concept about wealth and money that I read in **paul graham's** book `Hackers & Painters`.

Often times we mistake wealth for money, wealth is **something that people want**.

You make money by getting rewarded for the wealth you have created, take an example of Jan koum and Brian Acton, a few years back they had created `whatsApp` and fast forward their wealth was **rewarded $16 billion dollars**.

So how do we differentiate between a side project and a wealth?
well, your **users are the proof** for the wealth, you have created.

So the main take away is that you get rich by creating wealth, and you create wealth by building something people want.
